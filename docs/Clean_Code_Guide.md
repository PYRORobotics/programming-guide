# General Guidelines for Clean Code

***NOTE: There is no right and wrong to style.***

***Style is likely the most subjective feature of programming, even writing in general, and as such, any guide on this topic should be taken with a grain of salt. These suggestions are personallized to me (@bjrice13) such that I write code meaningful to me.***

***With that in mind, everyone should adopt their own style best fit for their own personal use, meaning everyone's styles will vary.***

*Several of these suggestions have been adopted from [this](https://youtu.be/ZsHMHukIlJY) very polarizing video.*

## 1. "Signal-to-noise Ratio": Don't Write Unused or Unuseful Code
Any code statement, i.e. variable, class, or function, that is not directly used by the program should be omitted.

Comments are incredibly important, but are also easily misused. Don't write a comment that simply puts the code statement into words. Rather, write comments that elaborate on the meaning or use of the code. Misleading comments can confuse any readers.

## 2. Spacing and formatting: Don't Mix Styles
* Typically, each line of code should be concise and not extend past column 80.

* Always put the opening brace following an argument list on a new line.

* Proper indentation is key! Try to allign code such that "child" lines of code don't overlap with their "parent" lines' allignments.

## 3. Useful Naming: Short and Sweet
* Try to name variables, classes, functions, etc., in a concise but direct manner.

* The purpose of naming is facilitate communication between the author and other authors or readers by giving the object meaning.

* Use comments whenever the name doesn't absolutely convey the object's meaning or use.

## Example:
Don't Do:
