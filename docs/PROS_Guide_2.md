To toggle the Git Tab, go to the top menu bar and select *View / Toggle Git Tab*.

## 2. Cloning a Project

### How to clone a Git repository:
1. Go to the repository's website on GitHub.
2. Click the green dropdown button "Clone or download".
3. Copy the link presented.
4. In the PROS Editor, open the command palette by pressing [ctrl] + [Shift] + [P].
5. Start typing *GitHub: Clone* and select GitHub: Clone.
6. Paste the link from step 3 in the "Clone from" field, and verify the "To directory" field is where you want the repository project to be saved.
